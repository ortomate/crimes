# Using `crimes` with coding agents

`crimes` was designed for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot
Workspace, Aider, OpenAI agents, etc.) operating in unfamiliar codebases. The
`--format json` output is the **stable contract** that agents should consume —
the human-readable report is a rendering of the same underlying findings.

This document covers:

- Pre-edit briefing with `crimes context` — the recommended first step
- Scan and post-edit gates — `crimes scan` and `crimes scan --changed`
- Triage — `crimes triage` for per-finding disposition + reason + owner
- Verdict — one-line branch summary
- Supporting commands — `crimes hotspots`, `crimes diff`, `crimes baseline`
- How to interpret findings as an agent
- What is guaranteed, what may change, and what is **not** implemented yet

If you are looking for the wire format itself, read
[`docs/json-schema.md`](./json-schema.md). For the catalogue of bundled
agent instructions (root `AGENTS.md`, Claude Code skill), see
[`docs/skills.md`](./skills.md).

## JSON for decisions, human output for readbacks

`crimes` ships two output modes for the same underlying findings.
Agents should treat them as different tools for different jobs:

- **`--format json` is for agent decisions.** Use it whenever you are
  planning an edit, gating CI, diffing two refs, or comparing finding
  counts before / after a change. JSON is the stable contract — the
  shape is documented in [`json-schema.md`](./json-schema.md) and
  versioned by `schema_version`.
- **Default human output is the canonical user-facing readout.** When
  the user wants to see the results, or you are summarising findings
  back in chat, rerun the same command without `--format json` and
  paste the relevant section. Severity glyphs, file groupings,
  evidence, feedback hints, suppressions, and gate status are all
  already rendered there for people to read.

Human output is **not** the schema contract — its wording, glyphs, and
layout can shift between minor releases. Don't parse it. But do treat
it as the canonical presentation: rather than paraphrasing the whole
JSON in your own voice, quote the human readout and add interpretation
only around the parts that matter for the task at hand.

---

## Per-agent integration

`crimes` ships with two on-disk artefacts that coding agents pick up
automatically when they open a repo that contains them. You do not need to
copy-paste anything into a prompt — they are loaded by the agent itself.

### Claude Code

A skill lives at [`.claude/skills/crimes/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/crimes/SKILL.md).
Claude Code discovers any `SKILL.md` under `.claude/skills/<name>/` and
loads it when the user invokes the matching skill (e.g. `/crimes` or when
Claude judges the skill relevant). The skill is short by design: it tells
Claude *when* to run `crimes`, *which* command to use, and *how* to read
the JSON.

Recommended Claude Code prompt fragments, if the user wants to add a
project-level reminder in `CLAUDE.md`:

> Before editing any file in this repo, run
> `crimes context <file> --format json` and read every `high` severity
> finding. After editing, re-run the same command or
> `crimes scan --changed --format json` and treat any new `high` finding
> as a blocker.

The root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) covers install / build / test /
architecture / safety rules — Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` as well, so you
get both layers (general agent rules + the on-demand skill).

### Codex CLI (and Codex-style agents)

[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the repo root is the convention Codex CLI
(and Aider, Cursor, Copilot Workspace, OpenAI agents, etc.) read on
startup. It contains:

- install / build / test commands,
- the four shipped `crimes` commands and their flags,
- project architecture and package boundaries,
- coding style notes,
- agent safety rules (no auto-publish, no shared-branch rewrites, no
  silent auto-fix of findings).

For Codex, the pre-edit / post-edit loop is the same as the rest of this
document — invoke `crimes context <file> --format json` before touching a
file, `crimes scan --changed --format json` after, and diff the findings.

### Other agents (Cursor, Aider, Continue, etc.)

Anything that reads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` will pick up the workflow
without further configuration. For agents that read neither, point them at
this document or copy the [Pre-edit briefing](#1-pre-edit-briefing-crimes-context) and
[Post-edit gate](#2-scan-and-post-edit-gates) sections into your project's agent-rules file.

### PreToolUse hook contract

`crimes init --agents` (since `0.11.0`) writes a Claude Code
`PreToolUse` Edit hook in addition to the SKILL.md files. The hook
runs `crimes context --format json` on the file being edited so the
agent gets a structured pre-edit briefing without having to remember
to invoke the command.

**Files written:**

| Path                             | Behaviour                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/skills/crimes/SKILL.md` | Unchanged (since `0.9.0`).                                                         |
| `.agents/skills/crimes/SKILL.md` | Unchanged (since `0.9.0`).                                                         |
| `.claude/settings.local.json`    | **New.** Merge-write of a PreToolUse Edit hook (see below).                        |
| `.agents/settings.local.json`    | **New (placeholder).** Same JSON shape; Codex does not honour PreToolUse yet.      |

**The hook itself** (merged into `.claude/settings.local.json`, never
overwritten wholesale):

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|NotebookEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npx -y crimes hook --format compact || true",
            "timeout": 8000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Contract details:

- **Matcher** is `Edit|Write|NotebookEdit` — the hook fires on every
  Claude Code tool invocation that mutates a file.
- **Command** runs `crimes hook --format compact`, which reads the
  hook JSON from stdin and prints a short pre-edit `crimes context`
  briefing for the target path. The generated shell command appends
  `|| true`, so failures never block the edit; unexpected hook errors
  still emit a short stderr warning so setup problems are discoverable.
- **Timeout** is 8 seconds.
- **Merge semantics.** `crimes init --agents` reads the existing
  `.claude/settings.local.json`, parses it, appends the entry to
  `hooks.PreToolUse[]`, and writes back (2-space indent, trailing
  newline). If the file already contains a crimes hook (detected by
  the `crimes hook` or legacy `crimes context` substring in `command`),
  the write is a no-op.
  A malformed existing file exits `2`; pass `--force` to overwrite.
- **`--no-hooks`** opts out of writing either settings file. The
  SKILL.md files still ship.

**Codex stub.** `.agents/settings.local.json` carries the same JSON
shape as the Claude file and uses the same stdin-reading `crimes hook`
command. Codex does **not** honour `PreToolUse` hooks as of
`crimes@0.12.0`; the file is a forward-looking placeholder so the
schema is ready when the Codex hook surface lands. A top-level `_note`
key documents this. Safe to delete.

The hook is **non-optional by default** because the briefing is the
load-bearing piece — an agent that never calls `crimes context` before
editing gets none of the value. If your team prefers to opt out, run
`crimes init --agents --no-hooks` or delete the settings file
manually.

## When to run which command

| Situation                                                       | Command                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| About to edit one specific file                                 | `crimes context <file> --format json`            |
| About to refactor across a directory                            | `crimes scan <path> --format json`               |
| Mid-task, want to re-check only the files you have touched      | `crimes scan --changed --format json`            |
| Reviewing a feature branch before merge                         | `crimes scan --changed --base main --format json`|
| Bulk-handling a backlog of findings on a legacy repo            | `crimes triage` (or `crimes triage --apply <file>` in CI) |
| One-line "did this branch help or hurt?" summary                | `crimes verdict --format json`                   |
| Comparing two committed refs (e.g. main vs HEAD)                | `crimes diff main...HEAD --format json`          |
| Gating CI on "no new debt vs the saved baseline"                | `crimes baseline check --format json`            |
| Adopting `crimes` on a legacy repo (snapshot, then commit)      | `crimes baseline save`                           |
| Triaging "where in the repo is the most change-risk right now?" | `crimes hotspots --format json`                  |
| Reviewing the whole repo from scratch                           | `crimes scan . --format json --all`              |

If you only learn one command, learn `crimes context <file> --format json`
— it is the cheapest, most file-specific entry point.

---

## Recommended workflow

### 1. Pre-edit briefing (`crimes context`)

**Start here.** Before touching any file, run `crimes context` on it:

```bash
crimes context path/to/file --format json
```

This is the single highest-leverage command in an agent loop. It returns the
per-file findings, the test files most likely to cover the target, the files
in the neighbourhood an agent should read first, and short safe-editing
notes — all deterministic, no LLM, no git history required.

If you are running against an unreleased checkout, invoke it from this
monorepo as `node packages/cli/dist/index.js context path/to/file --format json`.

The JSON shape is (canonical key order — `agent_guidance` first):

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "report_type": "context",
  "file": "src/billing.ts",
  "risk": { "level": "high", "high": 1, "medium": 1, "low": 1, "total": 3 },
  "agent_guidance": [
    "Prefer extracting pure helpers before adding more branches.",
    "Avoid adding more direct clock access; inject time where possible."
  ],
  "clues": {
    "churn": {
      "commits_90d": 14,
      "last_commit_at": "2026-05-18T12:30:00Z",
      "unique_authors_90d": 3
    },
    "suppressions": [
      {
        "fingerprint": "large_function::src/billing.ts::renderInvoice",
        "detector": "large_function",
        "reason": "Legacy billing module, rewrite planned",
        "pinned_version": "0.9",
        "matches_current_finding": false
      }
    ],
    "test_gap": {
      "raw": 1,
      "percentile": 0.85,
      "label": "top-quartile"
    },
    "related_signals": []
  },
  "related_files": [
    {
      "file": "src/nav/sidebar.ts",
      "reason": "related to Route Metadata Drift",
      "score": 0.4
    },
    {
      "file": "src/billing-policy.ts",
      "reason": "shares domain token \"billing\"; matches domain \"billing\"",
      "score": 0.4
    }
  ],
  "likely_tests": ["src/billing.test.ts"],
  "findings": [ /* same Finding shape as scan */ ]
}
```

How to use the fields (read in this order):

- **`risk.level`** is the headline (`none | low | medium | high`) — the worst
  severity present on this file.
- **`agent_guidance`** is one short line per finding type that fired,
  deduped. Read it first — it tells you what *not* to make worse before
  you read anything else. When the file has no findings but does have
  related files, you'll instead see one line pointing you at the
  neighbourhood.
- **`clues`** (new in `0.10.0`) is an optional object with up to three
  sub-blocks: `clues.churn` carries `commits_90d` / `last_commit_at`
  (ISO 8601) / `unique_authors_90d` and is omitted when git is
  unavailable; `clues.suppressions` is a per-file inventory of every
  suppression entry that scopes to this path (each entry carries
  `fingerprint`, `detector`, `reason`, `pinned_version`,
  `matches_current_finding`) and is omitted when empty;
  `clues.test_gap` carries the raw `{0, 0.5, 1}` value plus a
  repo-relative quartile `percentile` and a human `label`
  (`"top-quartile"` / `"median"` / `"bottom-quartile"` / `"unknown"`).
  `clues.related_signals` is always present as `[]` — reserved for
  future use. Frozen contract — safe to consume from a PreToolUse hook.
- **`related_files`** is a ranked, capped list (max 10) of other files
  in the repo that an agent should probably read before editing the
  target. Each entry carries a `reason` (`related to <charge>`,
  `shares domain token "<token>"`, `matches domain "<token>"`, or
  `same directory`) and a `score` sort key. Source-of-truth files for
  the same concept usually surface here — the labelled nav source for a
  route, the helper module for an API handler, the sibling pages in
  the same flow. Read these before editing.
- **`likely_tests`** is found by four deterministic conventions:
  same-basename `.test.ts` / `.spec.ts` siblings, Go-style
  `_test.ts` / `_spec.ts` siblings, files under `__tests__/` matching
  the basename, and test files that import the target via a relative
  path. Run these tests after editing.
- **`findings`** are the same Finding objects `crimes scan` would emit,
  filtered to this file. Read every `high` first.

When any of `agent_guidance`, `related_files`, or `likely_tests` is the
empty array, the corresponding `*_reason` field is set to a short
string explaining why (e.g. `"no neighbourhood signal: …"`). Treat
`[]` plus a reason as "we searched and found nothing", not as "we
didn't search".

When the change spans more than one file, run a scoped directory scan instead
of `crimes context` on each file individually:

```bash
crimes scan path/to/dir --format json
```

What to do with the result:

- **Read every `high` severity finding** in `findings[]` before you write code.
  Each one is concrete evidence that this area is risky to touch.
- **Treat `evidence` as ground truth.** It is generated deterministically from
  the AST or file contents — not from an LLM.
- **Use `lines` + `symbol`** to focus reading on the exact functions or ranges
  the detector flagged, instead of re-reading the whole file.
- **Use `suggested_actions[].kind`** as a hint for the kind of change the
  detector thinks is safe. They are heuristics, not instructions — pick the
  ones that match the user's request.

---

### 2. Scan and post-edit gates

After making a change, re-scan to see whether you introduced new findings.
The two most useful post-edit gates are:

#### `crimes scan --changed` (narrow gate, preferred)

`crimes scan --changed` restricts the scan to files changed in the working
tree (staged, unstaged, and untracked), optionally including everything
that differs between a base ref and `HEAD`. This is the cheapest scope when
you are mid-task and do not need to re-scan an entire directory:

```bash
crimes scan --changed --format json                     # working tree only
crimes scan --changed --base main --format json         # + commits on this branch
crimes scan --changed --base origin/main --format json  # + commits not yet pushed
crimes scan --changed --fail-on high --format json      # CI gate — exit 1 on a new high
```

Semantics:

- With no `--base`, staged, unstaged, and untracked files are all included.
- With `--base <ref>`, the additional set is `<ref>...HEAD` — i.e. commits
  unique to the current branch since it diverged from `<ref>`.
- Deletions are skipped — the file is gone, so there is nothing to scan.
- Non-source files in the changed set (Markdown, JSON, lockfiles, etc.)
  are filtered out via the configured `include` / `exclude` patterns.
- Outside a Git repository the command exits 2 with a clear error on
  stderr; the JSON output is **not** produced. Agents should fall back to
  a path-scoped `crimes scan <path>` when this happens.

The output is the same `ScanReport` shape as `crimes scan` — same
`schema_version`, same finding fields — just over a smaller set of files.

`crimes scan --changed` also populates a top-level **`changed_files`**
array on the JSON output, listing every file the resolver returned
(repo-relative POSIX, sorted, deduped) — **including files that
produced zero findings** (a touched `README.md`, a `package.json`
bump, a `.ts` file the detectors had nothing to say about). The field
is absent on plain `crimes scan`. Read it when you need to confirm
what your edit actually touched, even when the report is clean:

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "report_type": "scan",
  "summary": { "total": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0 },
  "findings": [],
  "changed_files": [
    "README.md",
    "src/billing.ts",
    "src/billing.test.ts"
  ]
}
```

`--fail-on` (CI gate, opt-in):

- Valid **only** in combination with `--changed`. Passing it on a plain
  `crimes scan` exits `2` (usage error).
- Accepts `low | medium | high`. `low` fails on any finding; `medium`
  fails on medium or high; `high` fails on high only.
- When set, the `ScanReport` JSON gains two optional top-level fields:
  `fail_on` (the threshold the run gated on) and `failed` (a boolean
  that flips to `true` when at least one finding in the changed set
  meets the threshold). Both fields are **absent** when `--fail-on`
  isn't passed — `crimes scan --changed` without the flag is unchanged.
- Exit `1` when `failed` is `true`; exit `0` otherwise. The human
  output ends with an `OK:` / `FAILED:` line summarising the gate.

Decision rule for agents: when `failed` is `true` after your edit,
treat it the same as a new high-severity finding in `crimes diff` — fix
or surface the cause before completing the task. See
[`docs/ci.md`](./ci.md) for the CI-side equivalent of this gate.

#### `crimes scan` (broad scan)

A directory scan is most useful at the start of a multi-file task, or
when you want to understand the overall risk profile of a subtree:

```bash
crimes scan .                            # file-grouped, top 5 files (default)
crimes scan . --top 10                   # show top 10 files
crimes scan . --flat                     # revert to severity-grouped output
crimes scan . --all                      # every finding across every file
crimes scan . --no-recency               # disable recency weighting in ranking
crimes scan . --format json              # stable JSON contract
```

The default human output groups findings by file, sorted by aggregate risk
(churn × test-gap quartile × blast radius × recency). Each file header
shows the finding count, high/medium tally, and a one-line Risk summary.
Use `--flat` if you want the old severity-grouped list; use `--all` to
see every finding without a file cap.

Decision rule (same for all scan commands):

- If your edit introduced a **new `severity: "high"` finding**, treat it as a
  blocker — either fix it before continuing, or surface it to the user with a
  short justification.
- If `agent_risk` increased on a touched file, slow down: you may have added
  a hidden source of truth, a duplicate rule, or a misleading name.
- If the total counts in `summary` went down, you are in a good state.

---

### 3. Triage (`crimes triage`)

When a scan turns up more findings than you intend to address in one
edit, the recommended path is **`crimes triage`**, not
`crimes baseline save`. Triage is per-finding: each entry carries a
disposition + reason + owner + date instead of bulk amnesia.

```bash
crimes triage                              # interactive walk over current findings
crimes triage --apply dispositions.json    # non-interactive (scripted use)
crimes triage --list                       # show current entries; no scan, no prompts
crimes triage --retriage src/billing.ts    # re-open the prompt for matching entries
crimes triage --clear <fingerprint>        # remove one entry
```

Five dispositions:

| Disposition    | Default `crimes scan` | Resurfaces on touched files? |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `fix-now`      | shown (`▶` prefix)    | n/a                          |
| `fix-this-PR`  | shown (`▶` prefix)    | n/a                          |
| `needs-design` | hidden                | yes — "still intentional?"   |
| `wont-fix`     | hidden                | yes — "still intentional?"   |
| `scaffolding`  | hidden                | yes — "still intentional?"   |

Entries persist to `.crimes/triage.json`, intended to be committed.
The schema is the same `<type>::<file>::<symbol-or-empty>` fingerprint
as baseline + suppressions; small line shifts don't invalidate an
entry. `reason`, `owner`, and `date` are required at the schema level.

**Resurfacing.** `needs-design`, `wont-fix`, and `scaffolding` are
silenced by default but **resurface automatically** when the file
appears in the branch diff against `config.triage.resurfaceBase`
(default `"main"`). The resurfaced finding carries
`previously_triaged: true` plus a `previous_triage` block (the
original disposition + reason + owner + date) and renders with a
`▼ was previously triaged` annotation in the human report. Baseline
entries get the same treatment with `previously_baselined` /
`previous_baseline`. Set `triage.resurfaceBase: ""` in
`crimes.config.json` to disable resurfacing.

New `crimes scan` flags introduced for triage / resurface:

| Flag                  | Default | Effect                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--show-triaged`      | off     | Include silenced dispositions in output (annotated with `hidden_triage`).                       |
| `--gate-needs-design` | off     | When `--fail-on` is set, count `needs-design` findings toward the gate.                         |
| `--gate-resurfaced`   | off     | When `--fail-on` is set, count resurfaced findings on touched files toward the gate.            |

Default gate semantics: `wont-fix`, `scaffolding`, and `needs-design`
are excluded from `--fail-on` (the user already triaged them).
Resurfaced findings are surfaced as a reminder, not a block. Opt in
with the flags above when your team wants stricter gating.

Decision rule for agents:

- When `crimes scan` shows a resurface block (`previously_triaged` or
  `previously_baselined` findings), read each entry and decide
  whether the original disposition still holds. If it does, leave
  the entry; if it doesn't, run
  `crimes triage --retriage <file>` to re-open the prompt.
- Don't reach for `crimes baseline save` to silence a noisy first
  scan. Run `crimes triage` and walk the list — the receipts
  (`reason` / `owner` / `date`) are the audit trail the team will
  need when the file changes again.

---

### 4. Verdict (`crimes verdict`)

When the agent finishes a task and wants a one-line "did this branch
help or hurt the repo?" answer, run `crimes verdict`. It is built on top
of `crimes diff`, so it inherits the same fingerprint matching and
working-tree-safety, but emits a single headline `verdict` instead of
the full new/fixed/unchanged breakdown:

```bash
crimes verdict --format json                  # default base: origin/main → main
crimes verdict --base main --format json      # override base
crimes verdict --fail-on new-high             # opt-in CI gate (exit 1)
```

Default base selection: `origin/main` first, then `main`. If neither
resolves the command exits `2` with a "no default base" error on
stderr; pass `--base <ref>` explicitly.

The JSON shape:

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "report_type": "verdict",
  "repo": { "name": "...", "root": "..." },
  "base": "origin/main",
  "head": "HEAD",
  "verdict": "worse",
  "summary": {
    "new": 2, "fixed": 1, "unchanged": 8,
    "new_by_severity":   { "high": 1, "medium": 1, "low": 0 },
    "fixed_by_severity": { "high": 0, "medium": 1, "low": 0 },
    "new_weighted": 5,
    "fixed_weighted": 2
  },
  "reasons": ["introduced 1 high-severity crime"],
  "recommended_actions": ["fix new high-severity findings before merging."],
  "new_findings":   [ /* same Finding shape as crimes scan */ ],
  "fixed_findings": [ /* ... */ ]
}
```

How to use the fields:

- **`verdict`** is the headline: one of `"cleaner" | "worse" | "unchanged"
  | "mixed"`. Read this first.
- **`reasons`** is a short array of human-readable strings explaining
  what drove the verdict. Quote them back to the user when summarising.
- **`recommended_actions`** is one or two lines suggesting next steps.
  Treat both `reasons` and `recommended_actions` as advisory copy —
  wording may shift across minor releases.
- **`summary.new_weighted` / `summary.fixed_weighted`** are the simple
  weighted scores (`high = 3`, `medium = 2`, `low = 1`) that drive the
  judgement. Treat as ordinal — exact weights may change.
- **`summary.new_by_severity` / `summary.fixed_by_severity`** are the
  per-severity counts on each side, useful when explaining the trade-off.
- **`new_findings[]` / `fixed_findings[]`** carry the full `Finding`
  shape — same contract as `crimes diff`. Quote `evidence` and `lines`
  when explaining what changed.

Judgement rules, in order:

1. **`unchanged`** — no new and no fixed findings.
2. **`worse`** — any new finding has `severity: "high"`.
3. **`worse`** — `new_weighted > fixed_weighted` (no new high required).
4. **`cleaner`** — `fixed_weighted > new_weighted` AND no new high.
5. **`mixed`** — both sides non-zero with equal weighted scores.

Exit codes:

| `--fail-on`    | Exit `1` when …                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(omitted)_    | Never — `crimes verdict` is advisory by default.                 |
| `worse`        | `verdict === "worse"`.                                           |
| `new-high`     | Any new finding has `severity: "high"`.                          |
| `new-medium`   | Any new finding has `severity: "medium"` or `"high"`.            |

Exit `2` is reserved for usage / environment errors (not a git repo, no
default base resolves, bad flag).

Decision rule: when `verdict === "worse"` because of a new high
finding, the agent should treat that as a blocker — same rule as the
rest of this document. When the verdict is `mixed`, surface the
trade-off rather than silently merging.

---

### 5. Communicate trade-offs explicitly

If you are leaving findings in the code on purpose, **say so in your PR
description or chat reply**, citing the finding `id` and `charge`. Do not
silently suppress findings.

Good:

> Leaving `crime_00001` (God Function on `generateInvoice`) as-is for this
> change — splitting it is out of scope for the bugfix you asked for.

Bad:

> Done.

## Supporting commands

### `crimes hotspots` — where in the repo is change-risk highest?

`crimes hotspots` uses git history to rank files by change-risk; on a
shallow clone (common in CI runners that default to `--depth=1`) the
report sets an optional top-level **`history_limited: true`** plus a
short `history_limited_reason`. When you see those, treat the ranking
as advisory — older commits are missing from the local copy. Deepen
the clone (`fetch-depth: 0` in GitHub Actions) to clear the flag.

```bash
crimes hotspots --format json
crimes hotspots --since 90d --format json
crimes hotspots --all --format json
```

JSON output is capped to the top 20 rows by default, matching the
human report. Check `hidden_count` before assuming the payload is
complete; pass `--all --format json` when you need every file.

### `crimes diff` — new / fixed / unchanged findings between two refs

When you have two committed refs and want the deltas — e.g. reviewing
what a feature branch did vs `main`, or what landed on `main` between
two releases — use `crimes diff`:

```bash
crimes diff main...HEAD --format json
crimes diff origin/main...HEAD --format json
crimes diff v0.1.0...HEAD --format json
```

The range must be the triple-dot form (`<base>...<head>`).

`crimes diff` is **working-tree-safe**: it exports each ref into a fresh
temp directory via `git archive` and scans it there. No checkout, no
stash, no temporary commits — your dirty working tree is preserved.

The JSON shape:

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "report_type": "diff",
  "repo": { "name": "...", "root": "..." },
  "base": "main",
  "head": "HEAD",
  "summary": { "new": 2, "fixed": 1, "unchanged": 8 },
  "new_findings": [ /* same Finding shape as crimes scan */ ],
  "fixed_findings": [ /* ... */ ],
  "unchanged_findings": [ /* ... */ ]
}
```

How to use the fields:

- **`summary.new`** is the headline gate: if it is `> 0` and any of those
  findings are `severity: "high"`, treat the branch as introducing
  regressions and either fix or surface them to the user.
- **`new_findings[]`** carry the full `Finding` shape — quote `evidence`
  and `lines` back when explaining what changed.
- **`fixed_findings[]`** are wins. Mention which charges this branch
  cleared when summarising the work.
- **`unchanged_findings[]`** are pre-existing debt. Don't relitigate
  them in the diff conversation — they were there before the branch.

How findings are matched across the two refs: stable fingerprint
`<type>::<file>::<symbol-or-empty>`, not the per-scan `id`. Small line
shifts from unrelated edits do **not** register as fix + new. See
[`docs/json-schema.md`](./json-schema.md#diffreport-output-of-crimes-diff-basehead)
for the full fingerprint rationale and known limitations (file renames
register as fix + new, identical-name nested helpers collide on one
fingerprint).

Decision rule, same as the rest of the workflow: a new `severity:
"high"` finding in `new_findings` is a blocker unless the user
explicitly accepts the risk.

### `crimes baseline` — gating CI on the saved baseline

When the repo has a committed `.crimes/baseline.json`, the agent loop can
run the same gate CI uses:

```bash
crimes baseline check --format json
crimes baseline check --fail-on high --format json   # stricter gate
```

`crimes baseline save` writes the snapshot; `crimes baseline check`
compares the current scan to that snapshot and fails on findings absent
from the baseline. Adoption flow:

```bash
crimes baseline save               # one-time per repo
git add .crimes/baseline.json
git commit -m "Add crimes baseline"
# … later, on every PR …
crimes baseline check
```

The JSON shape:

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "report_type": "baseline_check",
  "repo": { "name": "...", "root": "..." },
  "baseline_path": "/abs/path/to/.crimes/baseline.json",
  "fail_on": "medium",
  "failed": false,
  "summary": {
    "total_baseline": 5, "total_current": 5,
    "new": 0, "fixed": 0, "unchanged": 5,
    "new_by_severity": { "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0 }
  },
  "new_findings": [ /* same Finding shape as crimes scan */ ],
  "fixed_findings": [ /* BaselineEntry — fingerprint + identity fields */ ],
  "unchanged_findings": [ /* same Finding shape as crimes scan */ ]
}
```

How to use the fields:

- **`failed`** is the gate. `true` → at least one new finding meets the
  `--fail-on` threshold; exit `1`. `false` → exit `0`.
- **`new_findings[]`** carry the full `Finding` shape. Quote `evidence`
  and `lines` when explaining what's new vs the baseline.
- **`fixed_findings[]`** are `BaselineEntry` records (fingerprint + type
  + charge + severity + file + symbol). Mention which charges this
  branch retired. The minimal shape is intentional — once a finding is
  fixed, its old `lines` / `evidence` no longer make sense.
- **`unchanged_findings[]`** are the legacy debt the baseline pins.
  Don't relitigate them in the conversation — they were already
  accepted when the baseline was committed.

`--fail-on` thresholds:

| Value      | A new finding fails when its severity is …       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `"low"`    | low, medium, or high                             |
| `"medium"` | medium or high _(default)_                       |
| `"high"`   | high only                                        |

Exit codes:

| Exit | Meaning                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | No new findings at or above `--fail-on`.                                      |
| `1`  | At least one new finding at or above `--fail-on` — blocking.                  |
| `2`  | Missing or malformed `.crimes/baseline.json`, or a bad flag.                  |

Findings are matched by the same stable fingerprint
`<type>::<file>::<symbol-or-empty>` as `crimes diff` — small line shifts
don't register as fix + new. See
[`docs/json-schema.md`](./json-schema.md#baseline-on-disk-shape-of-crimesbaselinejson)
for the full schema and known limitations.

## Information architecture findings

`crimes@0.3.0` adds five **information architecture** detectors that
look for ambiguous sources of truth across the repo:

| `Finding.type`                  | Charge                       | Reads                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `missing_agent_context`         | Missing Agent Context        | `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` / `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` + `package.json` `bin`         |
| `route_metadata_drift`          | Route Metadata Drift         | Route file paths, default exports, `<title>` / `metadata.title`, and nav-source labels |
| `duplicated_navigation_source`  | Duplicated Navigation Source | Top-level nav-array literals across files                                              |
| `concept_alias_drift`           | Concept Alias Drift          | Path tokens, route paths, labels, nav entries, and doc headings                        |
| `docs_code_drift`               | Docs-Code Drift              | Local links in `docs/**/*.md` and root-level `*.md`                                    |

IA findings are **cross-file by design**. The `file` field anchors the
finding on the most useful single path (the route file, the
lexicographically first nav source, the alias-group anchor, the doc),
and `related_files` lists the other repo-relative paths that
contributed evidence. Treat `related_files` as "also read these before
editing" — same scope as the finding itself. The human reporter renders
those paths as an "Also touches:" block under each finding (capped at 5
with the rest summarised), so a grep-friendly run still surfaces every
file an agent needs to read.

**Why this matters for agents.** Without IA findings, an agent asked
to "rename the billing page" or "update the team copy" picks the file
it greps first and leaves every other source of truth stale. IA
findings make that ambiguity visible **before** the edit — every
`related_files` entry is a place where the same concept lives under a
different label, in a different file, with a different vocabulary.
Read them before choosing which one is canonical.

Each `agent_guidance` line is keyed on `Finding.type`:

| Type                            | Guidance                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `missing_agent_context`         | Agents may miss project-specific commands, architecture rules, and safety checks.                          |
| `route_metadata_drift`          | The route path, title, breadcrumb, and component name appear to disagree — verify each before changing labels. |
| `duplicated_navigation_source`  | Multiple files declare this destination; updating only one will leave the others stale.                    |
| `concept_alias_drift`           | Other files describe this concept under a different name; read them before renaming or extending.          |
| `docs_code_drift`               | Docs reference local files that no longer exist — update the docs in the same PR.                          |

**Key contract.** IA findings are **ambiguity signals**, not claims of
semantic truth. The detector phrases its summary as "appears to" /
"may" / "looks like" — and so should you when relaying a finding to a
user. Every evidence string is concrete (file path, line, literal
value); the *interpretation* of that evidence belongs to the human or
agent reading the report.

**No LLM, no API key, no network access** is required to produce these
findings. Every IA detector runs as a deterministic AST + markdown
pass. Two runs over the same repo produce identical IA findings.

For long-form per-detector reference (false-positive notes, quorum
rules, suggested fixes), see
[`docs/finding-types/ia.md`](./finding-types/ia.md).

## Petty crimes findings

Petty crimes are small, local maintainability signals that make code easier
to misread. They are not style lint. They exist because coding agents copy
nearby patterns, trust comments, and infer safety from names.

| `Finding.type`                  | Charge                   | Agent concern                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `commented_out_code`            | Commented-Out Corpse     | Disabled code can look like reusable implementation or current documentation.         |
| `logic_in_comments`             | Logic in the Alibi       | A business rule may live only in prose instead of guards, types, config, or tests.    |
| `name_behavior_mismatch`        | False Identity           | A safe-sounding function may write, send, track, charge, or otherwise mutate state.   |
| `magic_domain_literal_scatter`  | String Sprinkles         | Repeated domain strings invite another copy instead of a source-of-truth edit.        |
| `weak_test_signal`              | Test That Proves Nothing | A present-but-weak test can make an edit look safer than it is.                       |
| `option_bag_junk_drawer`        | Option Bag Junk Drawer   | Generic bags hide which fields an edit must preserve.                                 |
| `return_shape_roulette`         | Return Shape Roulette    | Divergent anonymous return shapes make callers infer the wrong contract.              |
| `negative_flag_maze`            | Negative Flag Maze       | Multiple negative flags are easy to invert while extending conditions.                |

When you see a petty crime, do not auto-fix it blindly. Read the evidence,
then decide whether the current edit needs to preserve, encode, rename, or
delete the suspicious pattern. For long-form reference, see
[`docs/finding-types/petty.md`](./finding-types/petty.md).

## How to read a finding

Every finding has the same shape (see [`json-schema.md`](./json-schema.md) for
the full type). The five fields that matter most to an agent are:

| Field              | What it tells you                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `severity`         | `"high" \| "medium" \| "low"` — the headline triage signal                         |
| `file` + `lines`   | Where the smell lives. `lines` is `[start, end]`, inclusive, 1-based               |
| `symbol`           | The function or method name when applicable (e.g. for `large_function` findings)    |
| `evidence`         | Concrete facts the detector observed — quote these back when explaining changes     |
| `scores.agent_risk`| `0–1`. Higher means easier for an LLM to misread, duplicate, or break this area    |

`severity` is for triage. `scores.agent_risk` is the more interesting signal
for an agent: it stays high even when the local severity is low, when the
area is structurally confusing (multiple sources of truth, weak tests, hidden
side effects, etc.).

**`scores.test_gap` — note for agents comparing exact values.** From
`0.10.0`, `test_gap` is a repo-relative quartile value (`0 / 0.25 / 0.5 /
0.75 / 1.0`) rather than the fixed mapping (`{0, 0.5, 1.0}`) used before.
Agents that compared `test_gap === 1` should switch to `test_gap >= 0.75`.

**`Finding.tier`** (new in `0.10.0`) is `"domain" | "nonDomain"`. Non-domain
findings come from paths listed in `config.scopeTiers.nonDomain` (defaults:
`scripts/**`, `examples/**`, `fixtures/**`, `public/**`, `**/__tests__/**`,
`**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`, `**/*.spec.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`). They appear in
a separate "Also flagged elsewhere" footer in the human scan report and
don't compete with domain findings for the default top-N. Set
`scopeTiers.nonDomain: []` in `crimes.config.json` to opt out.

Default sort order is aggregate risk-first (rank_score, derived from severity,
confidence, churn, test-gap, blast radius, and recency), then file path, then
line number. You can re-sort by `scores.agent_risk` if your goal is "what
should I read before editing", rather than "what is most broken".

## Concrete example

This is the actual current output of `pnpm scan:example:json` against
[`examples/messy-ts-app`](../examples/messy-ts-app), with the absolute repo
path sanitised:

```jsonc
{
  "schema_version": "0.1.0",
  "report_type": "scan",
  "repo": {
    "name": "messy-ts-app",
    "root": "/path/to/crimes/examples/messy-ts-app"
  },
  "summary": { "total": 19, "high": 0, "medium": 13, "low": 6 },
  "findings": [
    // …19 findings elided. The bundled fixture suppresses the
    // `large_function::src/billing.ts::generateInvoice` God Function
    // in .crimes/suppressions.json as a demonstration of the v0.5.0
    // workflow — see docs/suppressions.md. Run with --show-suppressed
    // to re-surface it annotated; rerun without the suppressions file
    // to see the original 20-finding output.
  ],
  "suppressed_count": 1
}
```

## What is and isn't shipped today

The brief above describes the workflow `crimes` is built around. Some of the
commands the PRD calls out are **not yet implemented**, and you should not
rely on them in agent instructions yet:

The pre/post-edit workflow works as `crimes context <file> --format json`
before touching a file, `crimes scan --changed --format json` after, and
`crimes verdict` for the one-line "did this branch help or hurt?" summary
at the end of a task. For a hard CI gate you have four equivalent options:
`crimes scan --changed --fail-on`, `crimes baseline check --fail-on`,
`crimes diff --fail-on new-high | new-medium`, and `crimes verdict --fail-on`
— see [`docs/ci.md`](./ci.md).

## Using suppressions in an agent loop

When a finding turns out to be deliberate (a legacy module under
rewrite, a route handler the team has agreed to keep monolithic, an
alias kept for backwards compatibility), the right answer is **explain
then ignore**, not silently skipping the report:

```bash
crimes explain large_function::src/billing.ts::generateInvoice
# → reads the rationale; the agent (or human) decides this is acceptable
crimes ignore large_function::src/billing.ts::generateInvoice \
  --reason "Legacy billing module — rewrite tracked in #1234"
```

`crimes ignore` requires a `--reason` and persists it to
`.crimes/suppressions.json`, which the team commits and reviews in
PRs. Agents should phrase the reason as a single specific sentence
naming the constraint or tracking issue — "too noisy" or "we know
about this" are not acceptable suppression reasons.

When a suppression becomes obsolete (issue resolved, code refactored,
team decision reversed), remove it:

```bash
crimes unignore large_function::src/billing.ts::generateInvoice
# → "Removed … from .crimes/suppressions.json. Commit the change …"
```

To audit the existing suppressions file — sorted by age, with
automatic flags for stale (>180d), short (<16 chars), or vague
reasons — run:

```bash
crimes audit-suppressions
crimes audit-suppressions --format json
```

See [`docs/suppressions.md`](./suppressions.md) for the full
workflow.

## Stability and schema versioning

- `schema_version` at the top of the report is the source of truth.
  `crimes@0.11.0` bumps it from `"0.1.0"` to `"0.2.0"` to add the
  required `effort` and `fix_shape` fields on every `Finding`. The
  shape documented in [`json-schema.md`](./json-schema.md) is stable
  within a `schema_version`; consumers that hard-checked `=== "0.1.0"`
  must accept `"0.2.0"` as well.
- Optional score fields (`scores.blast_radius`, `scores.churn`,
  `scores.test_gap`) are **populated by every scan from `0.6.0`
  onward** from the import graph, 90-day git churn, and the test-file
  index. They remain optional in the schema so consumers can keep
  tolerating absence in mixed-version environments (a `crimes scan`
  from a fixture saved before `0.6.0` still parses cleanly). See
  [`scoring.md`](./scoring.md) for the unified `agent_risk` formula.
- `scores.test_gap` changed from a fixed three-point mapping to a
  repo-relative quartile scale in `0.10.0`. Values are now `0 / 0.25 /
  0.5 / 0.75 / 1.0`. Agents that compared `test_gap === 1` should
  switch to `test_gap >= 0.75`.
- `Finding.tier`, `Finding.scores.recency`, and `ContextReport.clues`
  are new optional fields added in `0.10.0`. They are absent on scan
  output from earlier versions; tolerate their absence in mixed-version
  environments.
- `related_files` is populated by the IA detectors (since `0.3.0`).
  Treat its absence on a structural finding as "no cross-file context
  for this finding".
- Breaking changes to the wire format will bump `schema_version`. Agents
  should refuse to consume output whose `schema_version` they don't know.

## Exit codes

Default `crimes scan` is **advisory** — it always exits `0`, regardless of
findings. The same goes for `crimes diff`, `crimes context`, `crimes
hotspots`, and `crimes verdict` (without `--fail-on`).

Four commands have an opt-in **gating** mode:

| Command                                                          | Exit `1` when …                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crimes scan --changed --fail-on low\|medium\|high`              | A finding in the changed set meets the severity threshold.                       |
| `crimes baseline check --fail-on low\|medium\|high` (default `medium`) | A **new** finding (vs the saved baseline) meets the severity threshold.    |
| `crimes diff --fail-on new-high\|new-medium` (`0.5.0`)           | A **new** finding in the diff meets the severity threshold.                      |
| `crimes verdict --fail-on worse\|new-high\|new-medium`           | The configured verdict / severity threshold is hit.                              |

All three share the same exit-code contract:

| Exit | Meaning                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Command succeeded; no blocking findings under the configured `--fail-on`.     |
| `1`  | Blocking findings present — the CI gate.                                      |
| `2`  | Usage / environment error — bad flag, missing baseline, not a git repo, etc.  |

`0` and `1` always emit JSON on stdout when `--format json` is set. `2`
writes a human-readable error to stderr and emits no JSON, so consumers
can distinguish "gate failed" from "command broke" without parsing.

If you want to gate on a command that doesn't have `--fail-on` (e.g.
plain `crimes scan` without `--changed`), gate on the JSON yourself:

```bash
crimes scan . --format json \
  | jq -e '.summary.high == 0' >/dev/null
```

See [`docs/ci.md`](./ci.md) for the CI-side recipes built on these
exit codes.
